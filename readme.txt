Adds a metabox to the menu admin page listing users so they can be more easily added as custom links to the WordPress Custom Menus

== Description ==

Adds a metabox to the menu admin page listing users so they can be more easily added as custom links to the WordPress Custom Menus.

== Installation ==

Install like all other plugins.  This plugin has no options or settings.  Once activated a new metabox will show on custom menus screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see a new metabox on the menus page? =

Check that the metabox is turned on under Screen Options.  http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens#Screen_Options

= Can I restrict the users listed to a particular user role? =

No, currently this plugin has no options and it shows ALL users regardless of role.

= Will options be added? =

Maybe. I will at least restrict it to non-subscribers in a future version.

= When I select multiple users and try to add them to the menu only one gets added, what's going on? =

I know. This will be fixed before Version 1.0
